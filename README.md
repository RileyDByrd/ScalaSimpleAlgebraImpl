# ScalaSimpleAlgebraImpl
A simple implementation of Algebraic Data Types in Scala.

Trying to understand Algebraic Data Types in Scala by inspecting the Typelevel Cats project is difficult because it's a full-featured tool. Additionally, charts, albeit a helpful aid, are no substitute for actual code. Thus, the goal of this repository is to provide a simple implementation of BoundedSemiLattice and its parent classes (e.g. Semigroup) that are easily inspected and may be used to experiment with.
